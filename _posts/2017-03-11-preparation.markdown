At first I was a little bit sceptic about moving to another country (this was before I had my Erasmus experience). Would I be able to stay alive without my parents for this long? Doing laundry and cooking something else than spaghetti chicken curry with rice seemed pretty challenging All these skills that were still so new to me and I had yet to acquire. I am not joking, when I say I was (and still am) a bad cook. But at least the diversity in the meals I eat have gone up during my Erasmus, so there is that.

Once you have experienced the independence and responsibility that comes with living abroad for half a year or longer, there seems to be no way back. And even though I really love my parents and appreciate what they constantly do for me, I have noticed over the last couple of weeks, that I really value to be more independent. It is you that decides if you want to have chocolate chip cookies for dinner or want to nap at 6pm.

It has been over nine months now since I first had the crazy idea to be doing my internship in New Zealand. "But why are you going to New Zealand?" everyone said. "You are doing IT (laughter ensues)". By this time, I have heard this over and over again and my answer has always been: why not?   As to why I didn't choose a destination closer to home: there is none. I could have gone anywhere in the world, but the opportunity to go to New Zealand presented itself and I took it.

So almost ten months later and I finally managed to have everything sorted out. I have my accommodation, flights, passport, ID and driving license all sorted out and the date has been set. I will be leaving on Monday the 13th of March and will be coming home the 8th of September. For now, the plan is to travel one and a half months in New Zealand an one month in Australia after I finish my internship in June.

I took me a lot longer than expected to get everything in order, because I was an idiot by not getting my passport from the municipality before I left to Denmark on Erasmus. Because I did not report to them that I would be living abroad in Denmark for 5 months, I could not use the embassy's or consulate's services while I was there. This meant I had to wait until Christmas break to get my ID renewed and get a passport. The latter which I would not receive until late January, when I got back from exams in Denmark. This meant I could not actually apply for a Traineeship VISA for New Zealand up until the very end of January.

Now that the date is approaching rather quickly, too quickly if you ask me, I am starting to overthink everything. I don't think I have ever been this stressed for anything. I am moving to the other side of the world, to a city where I don't know anyone, which is pretty scary. It raises a lot of "what if scenarios" that can get stuck in my head for hours. I try not to think about it too much, because I know in the end everything will be fine, or great even.

I will be arriving in Queenstown, New Zealand on the 15th somewhere in the evening, where I can finally start the adventure I have been dreaming of. I am not making any promises as to when or even if I will be posting more on this blog. I will however try my best to keep this going.

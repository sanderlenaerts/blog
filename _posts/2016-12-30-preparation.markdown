At first I was a little bit sceptic about moving to another country (this was before I had my Erasmus experience). Would I be able to stay alive without my parents for this long? Doing laundry and cooking something else than chicken curry with rice or spaghetti scared me shitless. All these skills that were still so new to me and I had yet to acquire. I kid you not, when I say I was (and still am) a bad cook. But at least the diversity in the meals I eat have gone up, so there is that.

Even though I love my parents dearly and I appreciate all the things they have done for me (seriously though, always cooking for me, doing my laundry, driving me to my dorm, the list is endless), I don't think I will ever be able to live with them again. Once you have experienced the independence that comes with living abroad for half a year or longer, there is no way back. It is you that decides if you want to have chocolate chip cookies for dinner or want to take a nap at 6pm.

It has been over nine months now since I first had the crazy idea to be doing my internship in New Zealand. "But why are you going to New Zealand?" everyone said. "You are doing IT (laughter ensues)". By this time, I have heard this over and over again and my answer has always been: why the hack not?   As to why I didn't choose a destination closer to home: there is none. I could have gone anywhere in the world, but the opportunity to go to New Zealand presented itself and I took it.

So almost ten months later and I finally managed to have everything sorted out. I have my accommodation, flights, passport, id and driving license all sorted out and the date has been set. I will be leaving on Monday the 13th of March and will be coming home the 7th of September. For now, the plan is to travel one and a half months in New Zealand an one month in Australia after I finish my internship at the beginning of June.

I took me a lot longer than expected to get everything in order, because I was an idiot by not getting my passport from the municipality before I left to Denmark on Erasmus. And because I did not report to them that I would be living abroad in Denmark for 5 months, I could not use the embassy's or consulate's services while I was there. So I basically had to wait until Christmas break to get my ID renewed and get a passport. The latter which  I would not receive until late January, when I got back from exams in Denmark. This meant I could not actually apply for a Traineeship VISA up until the very end of January.

Quite stress inducing if you ask me. Gladly, everything worked out in the end.
